# getting-started-raspberry-pi

This tutorial will have several parts. As and end result we want to have a web site which show differnt informations from inside our flats: temperature, humidity, dust, light.. and also predict the values.

There are several things that are involved in this project: setting up a raspberry pi, setting up sensors and collecting data, storing the data (we will try with IOTA). On the consumer side we will have to read the data, analyse it, display it, train some models, write a website and deploy it.

This will all be done with Python.
