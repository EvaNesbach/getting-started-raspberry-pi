# getting-started-raspberry-pi

This tutorial will have several parts. As and end result we want to have a web site which show differnt informations from inside our flats: temperature, humidity, dust, light.. and also predict the values.

There are several things that are involved in this project: setting up a raspberry pi, setting up sensors and collecting data, storing the data (we will try with IOTA). On the consumer side we will have to read the data, analyse it, display it, train some models, write a website and deploy it.

This will all be done with Python.

## Things you will need:

* Raspberry PI 3 or higher
* Charger.. mini-usb phone charger should work
* Micro SD card: at least 8G
* Bread board
* Sensors, can be the DHT11, or equivalent
* one LED.. just for fun
* connecting cables


## Part 1 - Setting up your brand new Raspberry PI

In this part we will just set things up.. follow the instruction on [raspberry-pi-setup](pisetup/raspberry-pi-setup.md)
